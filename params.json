{"name":"Coco3-dev","tagline":"A quick guide for getting started with CoCo 3 development on OS X.","body":"Getting Started\r\n===============\r\n\r\nThis guide was written with MAME 0.162 as the active version. It works on Yosemite.\r\n\r\nStarting MAME\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nFor now, `cd` to ~/bin/mame so that mame knows where the roms dir is. Then::\r\n\r\n    mame64 coco3\r\n\r\nTo run with a particular floppy image::\r\n\r\n    mame64 coco3 -flop1 $FLOPPY_PATH\r\n\r\nAssembling 6809 ASM to Binary\r\n-----------------------------\r\n\r\nSimple, using LWASM from the LWTOOLS package::\r\n\r\n    lwasm -9 -b $SOURCE_FILE --output=$TARGET_FILE\r\n\r\nThe `-9` flag stipulates 6809 strict compatibility mode, as opposed to allowing 6309 instructions. The `-b` flag compiles the source to the DECB binary format, compatible with Color BASIC's `LOADM` command.\r\n\r\nDisassembling 6809 Binary\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\nUsing f9dasm, which is a little bit more permissive when it comes to reconstituting some of the funnier tricks you can do than MAME's own `unidasm` is::\r\n\r\n    f9dasm -nohex -noaddr $BINARY_FILE > $TARGET_FILE\r\n\r\nCreating Disk Images\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nFirst, create the disk image::\r\n\r\n    imgtool create coco_jvc_rsdos $DISK_NAME\r\n\r\nThen, add your intended files to the disk::\r\n\r\n    imgtool put coco_jvc_rsdos $DISK_NAME $LOCAL_FILE_NAME $DISK_FILE_NAME --ftype=binary\r\n\r\nSome Useful CoCo BASIC Commands\r\n-------------------------------\r\n\r\nTo load a binary into RAM from disk (some appear to have some kind of automagical loading logic that will start to execute the program on loading, but mostly not)::\r\n\r\n    LOADM \"$DRIVESPEC:$FILENAME\"\r\n\r\nWhere $DRIVESPEC is an integer in the range [0, 3], with 0 being the likely value if you've started the CoCo with flop1 mounted. You can be lazy and omit the drivespec if it's 0, as well as the file extension if it's `.BIN` since it's the default, and quotes auto-close at the end of commands, so if you're feeling lazy you can also type::\r\n\r\n    LOADM\"$FILENAME\r\n\r\nTo run the now-loaded binary::\r\n\r\n    EXEC\r\n\r\nTo chain commands, separate with a colon. This requires closing your quotes, though.\r\n\r\nCoCo BASIC Keymappings\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\nNative to CoCo\r\n\r\n@ - \"\r\n\r\n; - :\r\n\r\nMiscellaneous Environment Notes\r\n-------------------------------\r\n\r\nMAME requires the SDL2 runtime Framework.\r\n\r\nLinks to External Projects\r\n--------------------------\r\n\r\nMAME - http://sdlmame.lngn.net\r\n\r\nSDL - http://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php\r\n\r\nLWTOOLS - http://lwtools.projects.l-w.ca\r\n\r\nimgtool - http://www.mess.org/compiling_mess\r\n\r\nf9dasm - https://github.com/gordonjcp/f9dasm","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
